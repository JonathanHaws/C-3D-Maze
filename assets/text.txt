After dwelling over best way to structure directories to avoid folder fatigue is to have app for final export... assets for everything that will be baked into .exe. Which I think should be the default. As users are way more sensitive to file fatigue. And then finally code. But while being able to just download 1 exe is nice I wonder if rescources are all loaded into ram? Which could make more folders / files in final app preferable.
