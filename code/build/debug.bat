:: Really wondering the usefulness of debuggers after trying lldb, gdb, and cdb, 
:: Like if there is a need for a debugger then the code might just be bad.
:: By bad I mean not modular. If code is too inerconnected then it is hard to isolate the problem. In which a full view of the memory is needed.
:: But it with incremental development and testing, the code should be modular. So the need for a debugger is not needed.
:: Not to mention the amount of time it takes to set up a debugger. Like the oppurtunity cost. 
:: Ill try to use just partial memory dumps (print statements) and see how far I can get
:: Also command line debugging seems a lot convenient than using a gui.
